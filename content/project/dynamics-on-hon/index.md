Complex networks have been successfully used to study a large variety of phenomena, including the synchronization of oscillators, the emergence of patterns in nature, and the spreading of social contagions and epidemics. 

However, a pairwise description of these processes can be too limiting, as various systems in physics, biology, social sciences are characterized by many-body interactions, that can deeply affect the emergent dynamics of these systems. 

To capture the impact of higher-order interactions on dynamical processess we need to rely on more complex mathematical structures, such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes.
