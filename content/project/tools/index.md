In the last decades, advances in technology have generated an unprecedented amount of relational data across a variety of domains, which made network science theory a crucial tool to investigate biological, technological and social systems. 
A pivotal role in advancing network science has been played by the development of efficient algorithms and computational tools to analyze networked data. 

The goal of this project is to develop computational frameworks for the analysis of networks and their generalizations.
