abstract: Pairwise interactions alone are often insufficient to characterize contagion processes, as more complex mechanisms involving groups of three or more individuals may be at play. Such higher-order interactions can be effectively modeled using frameworks beyond complex networks, such as simplicial complexes. The presence of these higher-order interactions has been shown to play a critical role in shaping the onset and evolution of contagion processes. However, studying these dynamics can be challenging due to the high dimensionality of the state space of these structures. To solve this problem, numerous mean-field models have been developed. Nevertheless, these models often overlook the correlations between different subsets of nodes, which can significantly influence the system dynamics. Therefore, more detailed approximations that account for these correlations are necessary. In this paper, we present a novel pair-based approximation for studying SIS dynamics on simplicial complexes. The pair-based approximation takes into consideration the dynamical correlations that emerge within groups of nodes in a simplicial complex. Compared to individual-based mean-field approaches, this approximation yields more accurate predictions of the behavior observed in stochastic simulations of contagion processes on simplicial complexes. Specifically, the proposed pair-based approximation provides higher accuracy in predicting the extent of the region of bistability, the type of the transition from a disease-free to an endemic state, and the average time evolution of the fraction of infected individuals. Overall, our findings highlight the significance of accounting for correlations within groups of nodes when investigating dynamical processes on simplicial complexes, and suggest that the pair-based approach can provide valuable insights into the behavior of such systems.
