On Thursday 11 at 4.30pm, I will give a seminar about synchronization of chaotic oscillators in higher-order netwoks.
The seminar is organized by the Italian Statistical Physics Society and it aims at providing a platform for young researchers in statistical physics and beyond to talk about their work.
